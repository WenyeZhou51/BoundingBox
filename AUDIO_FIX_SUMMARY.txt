                        3D SPATIAL AUDIO FIX - SUMMARY
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
-----------
Your player couldn't hear the TV audio because:

❌ BEFORE (BROKEN):
   Camera3D → Inside SubViewport (World A)
   TV Audio → In Main Scene (World B)
   
   They were in DIFFERENT 3D worlds, so audio couldn't work!

✅ AFTER (FIXED):
   Camera3D → Inside SubViewport (World A)
   TV Audio → Inside SubViewport (World A) ← MOVED HERE
   
   Now they're in the SAME 3D world, audio works!


WHAT I CHANGED:
--------------
1. PlayerUI.tscn
   - Added: audio_listener_enable_3d = true to SubViewport
   - This enables the Camera3D inside to listen to 3D audio

2. TestScene.tscn
   - Moved ALL 3D scenes INTO the SubViewport:
     • WorldEnvironment
     • LivingRoomScene (contains TV)
     • HallwayScene
     • StudyScene
     • StairwellScene
     • KitchenScene
     • FreezerScene
     • DormHallwayScene
     • NavigationRegion3D


WHY THIS WORKS:
--------------
- In Godot 4, Camera3D automatically acts as AudioListener3D
- BUT Camera3D and AudioStreamPlayer3D must be in the SAME 3D world
- SubViewports create separate 3D worlds
- Solution: Put everything in the same SubViewport


THE CULPRIT:
-----------
It was NOT a fault with AudioListener or AudioPlayer individually.
It was a VIEWPORT HIERARCHY issue - they were in different 3D worlds!


TO TEST:
--------
1. Run the game
2. Go to Living Room
3. Turn on TV (left click on it)
4. Walk closer/farther - you should hear volume change
5. Walk left/right - you should hear stereo positioning


TV AUDIO SETTINGS:
-----------------
max_distance = 10.0 units → You must be within 10 units to hear it
volume_db = -3.0        → Slightly quieter than default
attenuation_model = 1   → Sound fades with distance
